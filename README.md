Mediasort
---------

This tool attempts to figure out what kind of media is being passed into it,
and then perform some action based on that classification.

For now, it is 100% undocumented, sorry! If you think this tool would be
helpful to you, let me know and I'll put some effort into making it consumable
without source diving.
